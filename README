About Me:
I am 23 years old and hail from the town of Appleton, WI.  I attended University of Wisconsin Stout and have recently graduated with a bachelors degree in Applied Math and Computer Science with a concentration in Game Design and Development.  Languages I have worked with include Java, some C and C++, XHTML, Javascript, some PHP, Actionscript, Unrealscript, and SQL.

Work History:
From 2004-2006, I worked at the local McDonalds on the grill crew.  I was tasked with working the grill, friers, and the assembley table as well as tasks such as cleaning the grill area, taking out garbage, and various tasks in the freezer.

From 2006-present, I have been working a summer job at School Specialty, a company that fills orders for school supplies, at their Greenville, WI distribution center as a stocker.  I have had to fill orders, stock warehouse shelves. stock expidited inventory, and occasionally train new stocking employees.

I unfortunately do not have any programming employment experience.
